\title{
Hypothesis testing on a scalar fixed-effect component in meta-analysis and meta-regression models
}
\description{
Performs hypothesis testing on a scalar component of the fixed-effects vector in meta-analysis and meta-regression models, using the signed profile log-likelihood ratio test and its higher-order Skovgaard's (1996) adjustment, as described in Guolo (2012).

\usage{
test.metaLik(object, param=1, value=0, alternative=c("two.sided", 
"less", "greater"), print=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{"\link{metaLik}"}.}
  \item{param}{a specification of which parameter is to be given confidence interval, either a number or a name. Default is \code{1} corresponding to the intercept.}
\item{value}{a single number indicating the value of the fixed-effect parameter under the null hypothesis. Default is 0.}
\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis, must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". Just the initial letter can be specified.}
\item{print}{logical, whether output information should be printed or not; default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\details{
\code{test.metaLik} allows hypothesis testing on a scalar component of interest in the fixed-effects vector. The asymptotic distribution of the evaluated statistics is the standard normal. 
Let \eqn{\theta} be the whole parameter vector. The signed profile log-likelihood ratio statistic for inference on scalar component \eqn{\beta} of \eqn{\theta} is
    \deqn{
r(\beta) = sign(\hat{\beta}-\beta)\sqrt{2 \{l(\hat{\theta})-l(\theta)\} },}
where \eqn{l()} is the log-likelihood function and \eqn{\hat{\theta}} is the maximum likelihood estimate of \eqn{\theta}.
The Skovgaard's (1996) adjustment is defined as
  \deqn{
\overline r(\beta) = r(\beta) + \frac{1}{r(\beta)}\log\frac{u(\beta)}{r(\beta)},
}
where \eqn{u(\beta)} is a correction term involving the observed and the expected information matrix and covariances of likelihood quantities, as described in Guolo (2012). Skovgaard's statistic has a second-order accuracy in approximating the standard normal distribution. In the rare case of equal within-study variances, Skovgaard's statistic reaches third-order accuracy.

The package checks whether the maximum likelihood estimate of \eqn{\tau^2} is not significant (see \code{\link{metaLik}} for details): in this case, the random-effect is dropped and Skovgaard's correction vanishes.

\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{First-order statistic}{the value of the signed profile log-likelihood ratio statistic and the associated p-value of the test.}
\item{Skovgaard's statistic}{the value of the Skovgaard's statistic and the associated p-value of the test.}
\item{alternative}{a character string describing the alternative hypothesis.}
