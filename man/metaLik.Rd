\title{
First- and higher-order likelihood inference in meta-analysis and meta-regression models
}
\description{
Implements first-order and higher-order likelihood methods for inference in meta-analysis and meta-regression models, as described in Guolo (2012). Higher-order asymptotics refer to the higher-order adjustment to the log-likelihood ratio statistic for inference on a scalar component of interest as proposed by Skovgaard (1996). See Guolo and Varin (2012) for illustrative examples about the usage of \pkg{metaLik} package. 
}
\usage{
metaLik(formula, data, subset, contrasts = NULL, offset, sigma2, weights=1/sigma2, 
level.tau2=0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{"\link{formula}"} (or one that
    can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the
    model to be fitted.  The details of model specification are given
    under \sQuote{Details}.}
  \item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object
    coercible by \code{\link{as.data.frame}} to a data frame) containing
    the variables in the model.  If not found in \code{data}, the
    variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which \code{lm} is called.}
\item{subset}{an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be used in the fitting process.}
\item{contrasts}{an optional list. See the contrasts.arg of \code{\link{model.matrix.default}}.}
\item{offset}{this can be used to specify an a priori known component to be included in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be \code{NULL} or a numeric vector of length equal to the number of cases. One or more \code{\link{offset}} terms can be included in the formula instead or as well, and if more than one are specified their sum is used. See \code{\link{model.offset}}.}
\item{sigma2}{a vector of within-study estimated variances. The length of the vector must be the same of the number of studies.}
\item{weights}{a vector of the inverse of within-study estimated variances. The length of the vector must be the same of the number of studies. If \code{sigma2} is supplied, the value of \code{weights} is discarded.}
\item{level.tau2}{significance level of the Cochran's Q test (Cochran, 1937) for between-study heterogeneity. Default is \code{0.05}. }
}
\details{
Models for \code{metaLik.fit} are specified simbolically. A typical model has the form \code{y ~ x1 + \ldots + xJ}, where \code{y} is the continuous response term and \code{xj} is the j-th covariate available at the aggregated meta-analysis level for each study. The case of no covariates corresponds to the classical meta-analysis model specified as \code{y~1}.

Within-study variances are specified through \code{sigma2}: the rare case of equal within-study variances implies Skovgaard's adjustment reaching a third-order accuracy. 

If the Cochran's Q test for between-study heterogeneity is not significant at the \code{level.tau2} than Skovgaard's correction is dropped, and only the signed log-likelihood ratio statistic is computed. We recomment the user to set values of \code{level.tau2} not higher than \code{0.05} because Skovgaard's statistic may become unstable when there is no evidence of between-study heterogeneity. \bold{Warning} Since version \code{0.40.0} the Cochran's Q test substitutes the bootstrap score test.

The fixed-effects estimate through DerSimonian and Laird approach (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986) is also supplied. In this case, the method of moments estimator of the heterogeneity parameter \eqn{\tau^2} is considered.
